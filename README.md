etc.) and generate a ranked list of players with their probabilities of winning the
award.

**Core components:**
- Automated data scraping from public football statistics sources (e.g., FBref)
- Feature engineering and dataset creation
- Machine learning modeling
- Output of top 10 player probabilities for each season
